Framework Overview LangChainPro

LangChainPro is a fictional framework designed for integrating multiple small language models into workflows.
It supports chaining outputs of models together and is optimized for low-resource environments. 
LangChainPro introduces a concept called “microchains,” which allows developers 
to split complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks.
