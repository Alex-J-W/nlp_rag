Local AI Models

GPTLocal is an experimental lightweight language model designed to work on edge devices 
like Raspberry Pi. Unlike larger models, GPTLocal is trained on highly specific datasets to perform 
tasks like home automation, personal note summarization, and offline Q&A systems.
GPTLocal was introduced in 2024 by an open-source community to address privacy concerns and 
reduce dependency on cloud-based AI solutions.
